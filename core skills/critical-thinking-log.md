1. The Opener

"You can see what we built hundreds of years ago. Now, we're letting foreign companies build our critical infrastructure."
Society has worked like this forever, Mattias Åström (founder and CE of Evroc, Sweden) is comparing apples and bears.
-> We learn from others' technologies
-> Technology as old as the wheel is everywhere but was not figured out by everyone
-> Weren't roads were built by the Romans and not the Gauls? The Gauls, or the Franc, or the French, have now improved their roads.

- What is Evroc: a company that is building the first European hyperspace cloud (claimed on their website).
*Hyperspace is a cloud search database using a virtual chip for fast, relevant results, with fast queries at scale and a hybrid search method.*
Advantages are definitely keeping data that is stored and used in-rule with EU legislature.
While they might not be direct-competitors in hyperspace cloud services, the EU has other key players: OVHCloud and Scaleway both from France, IONOS from Germany, CloudFerro from Poland.

2. Content

- Dependency on US-based cloud services:
- - AWS (Amazon)
- - Azure (Microsoft)
- - Google Cloud (Google)

"They have a 65% share of the world cloud market between them, according to Synergy Research Group." - ==verify,  still accurate 2 years later?==
"Ionos develops all its software in Europe, and its European servers are isolated from the US." - Not hit by US Cloud Act
"Responding to the issue of digital sovereignty, a spokesperson for Amazon Web Services said: "Our bi-annual transparency reports note that there have been no data requests to AWS that resulted in disclosure of data stored outside the US to the US government. This statement was added to the transparency report in 2020, and has been re-affirmed every six months since then." - ==verify==
Earlier mention of facebook fine (€1.2bn) in May 2023.

Gaia-X project - 377 organisations

Shared ecosystem between EU platforms to compete with AWS (and other US-based firms).

"The supply chain is where it starts to unravel," he says. "You might work with a managed service provider based in Birmingham [UK], and they might work with a UK data centre, but they might back up to Google. You have to ask those follow-up questions around the supply chain to really understand how sovereign you are," he says.
==necessary observation, just like food fairtrade, origin, etc==

"Concerns that EU companies and citizens have about their data being exported outside of the EU to countries with different privacy regimes are valid, but it's important to remember that the EU-US Data Framework that recently came into force does provide safeguards for the use of personal data by US national security agencies."
==thankfully, after NSA scandal 10 years before this article==

###1. Main Claim
formulation 1: The article's key message is the necessity of an European hyperspace cloud service. One that is european-owned with european-based servers. The goal is for EU data sovereignity and secured privacy for EU residents and citizens.
formulation 2: The article is putting forward Evros and other European firms', plus other interviewed experts', claim for a need of an European hyperspace cloud.

###2. The Evidence
formulation 1:
- US-based cloud giants (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) have a 65% share of the world cloud market according to Synergy Research Group (in 2023).
- There are been security/privacy breaches on the part of Facebook/Meta as seen by the record-breaking €1.2bn fine in May 2023.
- "If all the [European] cloud providers were able to share an ecosystem, we would be much stronger than AWS, Google and Microsoft." -R. Straeter, head of cloud development and digital ecosystems
==not exactly evidence but a claim==

###3. The Unstated Assumptions
I found M. Åström's quote very out of touch with reality and humanity as a whole.
It tackles the situation as a us versus them point of view. There are differences between the US and the EU, and for a considerable amount of reasons the EU wants to divert from associating with the US as much as it used to, but the ideal is still harmony.
Us versus Them is another version of Now versus Before. There's favoritism at play.
His observation of his direct surroundings is odd: he is in France, is he pointing out French critical infrastructure? Or is it European? Does he know how much they differ still from one country to the next even between neighboring countries?
As resident in Luxembourg who has visited nearly half of Europe: we are always in the EU but nowhere is the same as elsewhere. This applies for the people as well, and in Luxembourg we are the most open to multicultural exchanges.

BBC choosing this quote as an opener is purely setting up distance between the US and the EU. Formidable allies at times but behind closed-doors always a mess.

==This was not really 'unstated assumptions'-like so I'll move on==

The article did not have a big selection of data though.
I'll be verifying the 2023 SRG 65% claim.

https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/huge-cloud-market-is-still-growing-at-34-per-year-amazon-microsoft-and-google-now-account-for-65-of-all-cloud-revenues

Compared to 2018 the market share of every other services besides the top 3 plumetted from 48% to its current (as of the article's date) 36%.
This is for all cloud services.
The hold on public cloud share exclusively is even larger (71% vs 65%)
https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/european-cloud-providers-local-market-share-now-holds-steady-at-15
Europe has fallen behind from 2017 to 2022, and has stabilized since.

If they all combined together they would still not compete against the US firms in any way so far.
With hyperspace developing this could hopefully change but if you view reports on how the US firms are doing their market shares keep increasing more.

“The cloud market is a game of scale where aspiring leaders have to place huge financial bets, must have a long-term view of investments and profitability, must maintain a focused determination to succeed, and must consistently achieve operational excellence. No European companies have come close to that set of criteria and the result is a market where the five leaders are all US companies,” said **John Dinsdale**, a Chief Analyst at Synergy Research Group. “As US cloud providers continue to invest some €10 billion every quarter in European capex programs, that presents an impossible hill to climb for any companies who wish to seriously challenge their market leadership. Consequently European cloud providers have mostly settled into positions of serving local groups of customers that have some specific local needs, sometimes working as partners to the big US cloud providers. While many European cloud providers will continue to grow, they are unlikely to move the needle much in terms of overall European market share.”

R. Straeter, although knowingly, has dreams on EU competitivity still far out of reach.
EU laws imposing EU data to only be kept in EU by EU firms, so obligating data sovereignity, and not allow the EU firms to work as spartners to the big US cloud providers or off-loading/backing up their data on those platforms, is definitely a necessary step.

==stopping here, deadline, interesting read and I have a better understanding on how far behind EU still is in terms of data centers and Cloud services. If was also good to read on some names that I will undoubtedly see again.==
==Used Claude to assess w/ advices, decided to apply its feedback on session 2.==
