1) **The Main Claim**:

The article argues that EU data stored with US cloud providers risks privacy violations and regulatory non-compliance, and should therefore be kept with European cloud providers.

2) **The Evidence** (4 points):

1. US cloud giants have 65% market share (Synergy Research Group)
2. Facebook/Meta €1.2bn fine in May 2023
3. Evroc has secured €15m in seed funding
4. 377 organisations participating in the Gaia-X project

3) **The Unstated Assumptions** (3 claims):

1. The article assumes that keeping data in Europe automatically provides better privacy protection than US-based storage.
2. The article assumes that if European providers "band together" they would be able to compete with US Data Giants (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
3. The article assumes that regulatory compliance means data being more secure.
