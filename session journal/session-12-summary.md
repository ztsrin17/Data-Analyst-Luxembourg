# Session 12 Summary

## What I Revised & Learned

### SQL Ranking Functions
- **DENSE_RANK() implementation**: Using window functions with PARTITION BY for customer-specific ranking
- **CTE methodology**: Building complex queries through layered Common Table Expressions
- **JOIN strategy optimization**: LEFT JOIN approach to preserve non-member records while adding ranking data

### Excel Formula Mastery
- **Conditional logic patterns**: IF, IFS, and nested conditional structures for business rules
- **Lookup function progression**: From VLOOKUP to XLOOKUP for data retrieval and matching
- **Advanced calculation techniques**: SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, and conditional aggregation functions

## What I Did

### Danny's Diner Extra 2 Completion
- **Ranking query development**: Built complex SQL using 3-layer CTE structure (base → member_orders → member_orders_ranks)
- **NULL handling strategy**: Implemented LEFT JOIN to show NULL rankings for non-member orders
- **Tie management**: Used DENSE_RANK() to handle same-date orders with consistent ranking

### Data Export & Analysis Setup
- **CSV generation**: Exported 4 key result sets for further analysis (master data, spending summary, menu popularity, pre-membership summary)
- **Table extraction**: Converted all 3 database tables to CSV format for external analysis

### Excel Skills Reinforcement
- **Wiseowl exercises**: Completed 19 exercises across basic skills, formulae creation, and conditional logic
- **ExcelPractice.online**: Finished 17 exercises covering range functions, lookups, and advanced formulas
- **Complex scenario modeling**: Built multi-tier pricing, voucher systems, and conditional commission structures

## Key Challenges and Solutions

### SQL Ranking Complexity
- **Challenge**: Creating member-only rankings while preserving complete dataset
- **Solution**: Multi-CTE approach with filtered ranking table joined back to base data

### Excel Business Logic Implementation
- **Challenge**: Translating complex business rules into formula structures
- **Solution**: Developed systematic IF-statement patterns for parking fees, commission tiers, and voucher systems

## Key Technical Insights

### SQL Window Functions
- **PARTITION BY usage**: Customer-specific ranking without losing cross-customer context
- **CTE layering**: Breaking complex logic into manageable, testable components
- **JOIN condition precision**: Multiple-key joins for accurate data matching

### Excel Formula Patterns
- **Threshold-based logic**: Consistent patterns for tier-based calculations
- **Absolute referencing**: Strategic use of $-notation for scalable formula structures
- **Conditional aggregation**: SUMIFS/COUNTIFS for filtered data analysis

## Session Conclusion
- **Danny's Diner fully complete**: All 10 questions plus 2 extras with strategic analysis
- **Excel proficiency restored**: Core functions and advanced conditional logic refreshed
- **Analysis toolkit expanded**: SQL ranking and Excel modeling capabilities enhanced
