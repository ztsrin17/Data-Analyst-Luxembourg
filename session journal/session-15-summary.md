# Session 15 Summary

## What I Revised & Learned

### Power Query Advanced Operations
- **Merge vs Append methodology**: Horizontal table joins using matching keys versus vertical row stacking for similar structures
- **Join type selection**: Left, Right, Inner, Full Outer joins for different data relationship scenarios
- **Column expansion techniques**: Selective field inclusion when merging tables to avoid redundant data

### Data Integration Workflows
- **Multi-source data combining**: ETL processes for disparate file formats and structural variations
- **Function creation in Power Query**: Parameterized transformation logic for repeatable data cleaning operations
- **Query performance optimization**: Staging approach with filter-first, then merge/append methodology

### Pivot Table Enhancement Features
- **Calculated fields implementation**: Custom metrics creation within pivot table structure for VAT calculations and derived measures
- **Slicer integration**: Interactive visual filters for dashboard-style pivot table controls
- **Pivot chart connectivity**: Automated chart updates synchronized with pivot table changes

## What I Did

### Power Query Merge/Append Practice
- **Danny's Diner case study extension**: Merged customer spending and pre-membership data using customer_id keys
- **Wiseowl exercise completion**: Combined three friends' exercise data from different formats using append operations
- **Multi-format data integration**: Processed space-delimited text, structured tables, and pivot-formatted data into unified structure

### Luxembourg Housing Data Project
- **Large-scale ETL implementation**: Processed 16 years (2009-2024) of rental apartment data across multiple worksheets
- **Custom function development**: Created generalized data cleaning function for consistent transformation across all years
- **Dashboard creation**: Built 2024 rental market analysis with KPIs and comparative visualizations

### Advanced Pivot Table Applications
- **Multi-dimensional analysis**: Created pivot tables for rental market activity, pricing, and value analysis
- **Top 10 ranking implementations**: Sorted and filtered data for most active markets, expensive municipalities, and best value locations
- **Weighted average calculations**: Implemented SUMPRODUCT/SUM formulas for accurate market-wide metrics

## Key Challenges and Solutions

### Multi-Year Data Consistency
- **Challenge**: Handling municipal boundary changes and varying data structures across 16 years of housing data
- **Solution**: Acknowledged data limitations explicitly while building Version 1 dashboard, documenting future enhancement needs

### Function Generalization in Power Query
- **Challenge**: Converting specific transformation steps into reusable parameterized functions
- **Solution**: Systematic abstraction of year-specific operations into dynamic function parameters with AI assistance for code generalization

### Complex Data Structure Integration
- **Challenge**: Combining three different data format types (text files, structured tables, pivot layouts) into unified analysis
- **Solution**: Format-specific transformation pipelines with unpivot operations and consistent column naming conventions

## Key Technical Insights

### Power Query Operation Selection Framework
- **Merge decisions**: Choose when adding new columns from related tables based on matching keys
- **Append decisions**: Select when adding new rows from similar-structure tables across time periods or categories
- **Performance considerations**: Stage with filter/reduce operations before merge/append for large dataset efficiency

### Luxembourg Housing Market Analysis Results
- **Market concentration**: Top 10 municipalities represent 80% of rental listings, with Luxembourg City accounting for over 50%
- **Pricing disparities**: Weiler-la-Tour commands highest average rents (€2,785) while Weiswampach offers best value (€17.24/m²)
- **KPI calculations**: National average rent €1,632.49, weighted average €36.32/m², total 10,490 offers analyzed

### Dashboard Design Implementation
- **Version 1 approach**: Build functional dashboard with current data limitations while documenting future enhancements
- **Professional documentation**: Explicit limitation statements in README format for mature analytical presentation
- **Progressive complexity**: Start with basic pivot tables, advance to calculated fields and interactive slicers

## Tool Comparison Refinement

### Power Query vs Traditional Excel Methods
- **Power Query advantages**: Repeatable ETL workflows, function creation, multi-source integration with audit trail
- **Excel formula limitations**: Manual repetition across years, no centralized transformation logic, limited multi-source handling
- **Use case optimization**: Power Query for large-scale data preparation, Excel formulas for final dashboard calculations

## Session Conclusion
- **Advanced Power Query mastery**: Implemented merge/append operations with custom functions for large-scale data integration
- **Real-world project application**: Completed comprehensive housing market analysis using Luxembourg government datasets
- **Professional workflow development**: Established Version 1/Version 2 project approach with explicit limitation documentation and future enhancement planning
