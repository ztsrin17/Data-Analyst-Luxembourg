# Session 9 Summary

## What I Revised & Learned

### Three-Table JOIN Operations
- **Progressive JOIN strategy**: Starting with core business logic tables, then adding reference tables (like menu) only when needed for final output
- **INNER JOIN for filtering**: Using INNER JOIN with members table automatically excludes non-members from results
- **Late-stage reference JOINs**: Adding menu table JOIN only at the end when product names are needed for display

### Question Interpretation and Pivoting
- **Initial misinterpretation**: Started with member-specific analysis when question asked about all customers
- **Two valuable interpretations identified**:
  - Most popular first purchase after becoming a member (attraction)
  - Most popular item for each customer post-membership (retention)
- **Business value recognition**: Both interpretations provide different strategic insights for the business

### Data Ambiguity Handling
- **Same-date scenario**: When order_date equals join_date, no way to determine sequence
- **Business assumption**: Decided that orders on join_date count as member orders (retroactive rewards logic)
- **Documentation importance**: Explicitly stating assumptions about edge cases in analysis

### Multi-CTE Complex Queries
- **CTE1 for aggregation**: Grouping and counting purchases per customer per product
- **CTE2 for ranking**: Adding RANK() to identify multiple favorites within each customer
- **Final SELECT for presentation**: JOINing with menu for readable output

## What I Did

### Danny's Diner Case Study Questions
- **Question 5**: "Which item was the most popular for each customer? (bonus: member)"
- **Initial approach**: Built member-specific analysis with detailed business logic
- **Correction**: Realized question scope was broader than member-only analysis
- **Question 6**: "Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?"

### Complex Query Development Process
- **Q5**: Most popular item per customer, and per customer post-membership
  - CTE1: Aggregated purchase counts per customer per product
  - CTE2: Ranked products by purchase frequency within each customer
  - Final: JOINed with menu for product names
  - Extra: Filtered by order_date >= join_date and members table INNER JOIN
- **Q6**: Most popular first purchase after membership
  - Used RANK() with PARTITION BY customer for first purchase identification (sorted by order_date ASC)
  - Filtered by order_date >= join_date for member-only orders
  - Grouped and counted first purchases by product

### Project Organization Improvements
- **README completion**: Finished documentation for questions 1-4
- **README completion 2**: Finished documentation for questions 5-6
- **Progressive insights**: Started building recommendations section incrementally rather than at end
- **Proper formatting**: Maintaining consistent markdown structure throughout

## Key Challenges and Solutions

### Data Interpretation Ambiguity
- **Challenge**: Order_date = join_date scenarios create ambiguity about member status timing
- **Business consideration**: How should same-day orders be treated?
- **Solution**: Made explicit assumption that same-date orders count as member orders
- **Documentation**: Clearly stated assumption in analysis notes

### Question Scope Clarification
- **Challenge**: Initially interpreted "each customer" as "each member"
- **Recognition**: Question asks about all customers, not just members
- **Course correction**: Rebuilt query for broader customer base
- **Learning**: Importance of careful question reading before implementation
- **Positive takeaway**: More customer information, although pre-membership vs post-membership would also be interesting to query.

### Complex Multi-CTE Logic
- **Challenge**: Building logical flow through multiple CTEs for ranking analysis
- **CTE1 strategy**: Focus on core business logic (counting purchases per customer per product)
- **CTE2 strategy**: Add analytical layer (ranking favorites within customers)
- **Final SELECT strategy**: Add presentation layer (readable product names)

## Key SQL Patterns Employed

### Member-Only Analysis with Date Filtering
```sql
WITH member_first_purchases AS (
    SELECT
        s.customer_id,
        s.product_id,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY s.customer_id
            ORDER BY s.order_date ASC
        ) AS purchase_rank
    FROM sales s
    INNER JOIN members m ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
    WHERE
        s.order_date >= m.join_date
)
```

### Multi-CTE Aggregation and Ranking
```sql
WITH post_membership_purchases AS (
    SELECT
        s.customer_id,
        s.product_id,
        COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
    FROM sales s
    INNER JOIN members m ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
    WHERE
        s.order_date >= m.join_date
    GROUP BY
        s.customer_id,
        s.product_id
),
ranked_favorites AS (
    SELECT
        pmp.customer_id,
        pmp.product_id,
        pmp.purchase_count,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY pmp.customer_id
            ORDER BY pmp.purchase_count DESC
        ) AS fav_rank
    FROM post_membership_purchases pmp
)
```

### Progressive JOIN Strategy
- **Stage 1**: Core business logic with sales and members tables
- **Stage 2**: Analytical processing within CTEs
- **Stage 3**: Reference table JOIN (menu) only for final presentation

### Business Logic Documentation
- **Assumption statements**: Explicitly documenting edge case handling
- **Multiple interpretation value**: Recognizing when different question interpretations provide different business insights
- **Progressive insight building**: Adding to summary sections as analysis progresses rather than waiting until end
