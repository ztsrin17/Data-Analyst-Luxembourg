- **XLOOKUP mastery**: Modern lookup function with wildcard matching, reverse search, and custom error handling

### Lookup Function Evolution
- **VLOOKUP to XLOOKUP progression**: Understanding legacy vs modern approaches for data retrieval
- **INDEX-MATCH combinations**: Advanced lookup techniques using MATCH for dynamic column referencing
- **HLOOKUP applications**: Horizontal data lookup for transposed data structures

### Pivot Table Analytics
- **Data aggregation techniques**: Converting raw data into meaningful business insights through pivot analysis
- **Multi-dimensional analysis**: Cross-tabulating customer behavior, product performance, and temporal patterns
- **Conditional filtering**: Member vs non-member analysis with date-based segmentation
