First week of SQL.  

Although the name of this website states 8 weeks we are going to be heavily practicing SQL for a week.  
It will then weave itself into Excel and Python the following weeks.  

To reproduce my analysis, first run the schema.sql script to build and populate the database.  
Then, you can run the queries in solutions.sql to see the answers to the case study questions.  

To be updated with brief summary of key findings.
